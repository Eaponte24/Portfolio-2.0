## Description
A simple and clean portfolio built to showcase my projects and resume for future employers. As well, there is a simple way to contact or connect with me with easy to click icons at the botton of the app. You are welcomed with the about page which describes a bit about me and more skills. The app allows for an easy way to keep my current works updated with ease as well as update styling on any components.


This application is built on **React**. My portfolio is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://eaponte24.github.io/Portfolio-2.0/).


## Usage
When you load the [portfolio](https://eaponte24.github.io/Portfolio-2.0/) you'll be greeted by a landing page where you can either click the portrait that is shown or you have 3 icons at the bottom of the page that will link you to various sites to view more of my credentials. Once you've clicked on the portrait you will be taken to the "About Page" along with other links in the nav bar in the top right. If you want to go back to the landing page then all you need to do is click the header in the top left of "Enrique Aponte‚Äù


### Landing Page
Once you access the portfolio link you will be prompted with a landing page with a slow fade in. You have a few options of either clicking the portrait to enter the portfolio or to click on any of the icons in the footer to access other sites with more credentials.
