## Features

The main feature of this project is to show future employers or clients my works I’ve made in the Uconn Bootcamp. The links in the top nav bar will bring you down to the correlating sections in the bottom of the page, in the future “resume” will contain my resume with updated works I’ve created. The about me section just states a little about me. When we move over to the Work section, it shows my 4 best projects and at default they are opaque but when you hover over them to click on them when a project is linked in the future they turn to 100% clarity. Lastly the contact me sections links all bring you to either calling my phone number directly, emailing me directly or a link straight to my github to see my current repos inside.

Here is a link to the deployed site.
